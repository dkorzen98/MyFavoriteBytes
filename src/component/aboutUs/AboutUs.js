    <p className="">This wdeb application is built for those food lovers who love to cook, but get tired of searching through their cookbooks in order to find their recipes. The idea behind this is I got tired of watching my mom dig through recipe books to find what the dessert or meal she is going to prepare for family, and then text everyone. Using this application you can add recipes to your cookbook and add family members to your account. In doing this you can then send the recipe to everyone via text, so everyone is on the same page. </p>
